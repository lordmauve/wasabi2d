    :alt: Welcome to Wasabi2d


Wasabi2d is a game engine for Python, making it easy to use fast, modern
graphical effects without low-level OpenGL programming.

Wasabi2d is

* Capable: draw sprites, polygons, lines, text labels and more
* Pretty, thanks to fast, built-in effects such as

    * :doc:`Particles <particles>`
    * :doc:`Full-screen post-processing effects <effects>`

* Written in "pure" Python (but relies on native extensions like Numpy)
* Fast due to heavy use of numpy, ModernGL and GPU acceleration
* Convenient, with an innovative (but optional) :doc:`coroutine <coros>`
  programming model.
* Works on Windows, Linux and Mac.
* Fully featured; wasabi2d does not just support graphics but screenshots,
  sound, music, tones, storage and more.
